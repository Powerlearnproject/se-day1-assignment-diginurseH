#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
Software Engineering is the process of designing, building, testing, and maintaining software in a structured and organized way. It ensures that software is reliable, efficient, and easy to use.


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering applies systematic design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance principles to create high-quality software systems. It powers digital transformation, enhances efficiency, scalability, and security, and supports emerging technologies like AI and cloud computing. Essential for healthcare, finance, and automation, it ensures reliable, user-friendly, and innovative software solutions​
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of Programming Languages (1950s-1960s)

Introduction of Fortran (1957) and C (1972) enabled structured, high-level programming, improving efficiency and readability.
Structured Programming & Software Engineering Discipline (1960s-1970s)

Software engineering emerged as a formal discipline, emphasizing modularity, control flow, and reduced errors.
Agile Methodologies (2000s-Present)

Agile frameworks like Scrum and Kanban replaced Waterfall, enhancing iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of the following phases:

Requirements Gathering – Identifying and documenting user needs and system specifications.
Design – Creating software architecture, UI/UX layouts, and system workflows.
Implementation – Writing and compiling code based on the design specifications.
Testing – Conducting unit, integration, and system tests to ensure quality and functionality.
Deployment – Releasing the software to users or production environments.
Maintenance – Providing updates, bug fixes, and enhancements after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Feature	          Waterfall	                                                      Agile
Approach      	  Sequential, phase-by-phase development	                      Iterative, flexible, and incremental
Flexibility	      Rigid, changes are difficult once the process starts  	      Adaptable, allows continuous modifications
Testing	          Done after development is complete	                          Continuous testing throughout development
Project Type    	Best for well-defined projects with stable requirements        Suitable for dynamic projects with evolving needs

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer

Writes, tests, and maintains code.
Implements software features and fixes bugs.
Works with designers and testers to ensure smooth functionality.
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer

Develops and executes test plans to identify software defects.
Conducts unit, integration, and performance testing.
Ensures the software meets quality standards before release.
Project Manager

Oversees planning, execution, and delivery of the software project.
Manages timelines, budgets, and team coordination.
Ensures project goals align with business and user requirements.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) streamline coding by providing debuggers, editors, and compilers in one interface, improving efficiency. Examples include VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and Eclipse. Version Control Systems (VCS) like Git and GitHub ensure code tracking, collaboration, and rollback options, preventing data loss and enhancing software quality, scalability, and teamwork in development

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Software engineers face changing requirements, tight deadlines, debugging issues, technical debt, and security vulnerabilities. Agile methodologies help adapt to changes, while Scrum sprints improve time management. Debugging tools, code reviews, and refactoring enhance quality. Security threats are mitigated through encryption and audits, ensuring scalable, efficient, and secure software solutions.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting precise and structured instructions to optimize AI-generated responses. It ensures that AI understands context, intent, and specificity, improving accuracy. Effective prompt engineering enhances chatbots, virtual assistants, and AI-driven healthcare tools, making interactions efficient, relevant, and user-friendly for tasks like medical inquiries and diagnostics.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: “Tell me about health.”
Improved Prompt: “Explain the impact of AI on mental health diagnosis, including benefits and challenges.”

Why is the improved prompt better?

Specificity – Focuses on AI and mental health, reducing irrelevant responses.
Clarity – Defines the scope (diagnosis, benefits, challenges) for targeted information.
Conciseness – Uses clear, direct wording to avoid ambiguity.
